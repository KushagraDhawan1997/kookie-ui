# 🍪 KookieUI

KookieUI is a **design system** – more than a UI toolkit.
It provides **foundations, components, and patterns** that make it easy to build consistent, accessible, and modern apps.

Built on top of [Radix](https://radix-ui.com), KookieUI inherits accessibility and composability out of the box, and adds:

- 🎨 **Foundations** – spacing, radii, colors, shadows, motion, tokens (coming soon)
- 🧩 **Components** – accessible, themeable React primitives (coming soon)
- 🔧 **Patterns** – best practices for common UX flows (coming soon)
- 🔀 **Composed Components** – opinionated building blocks for speed (coming soon)
- 📐 **Templates** – real-world starting points (coming soon)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @kushagradhawan/kookie-ui
# or
yarn add @kushagradhawan/kookie-ui
# or
pnpm add @kushagradhawan/kookie-ui
```

### Usage

  return <Button>Hello Kookie</Button>;
}
```

## 📦 What's Inside?

KookieUI is structured around **five layers**:

- **Foundations** → design tokens (spacing, radius, colors, motion)
- **Components** → core primitives (`Button`, `Avatar`, `Card`, `Dialog`, …)
- **Patterns** → recipes (loading states, adaptive command bar, forms, …)
- **Composed Components** → higher-order widgets (`UserCard`, `PropertyControl`, …)
- **Templates** → pre-built layouts (marketing, dashboards, auth flows)
