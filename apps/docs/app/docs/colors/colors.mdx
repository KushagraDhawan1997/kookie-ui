# Colors

Kookie UI uses [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) because it's a fork of Radix Themes.

## Radix Colors

Since Kookie UI is a fork of Radix Themes, it inherits the Radix Colors system. Radix Colors provides a comprehensive, accessible color system that's already well-designed and tested. Rather than replacing it, I'm focusing on making sure these colors work consistently throughout the design system.

The Radix color system includes:
- **12-step scales** for each color family
- **Automatic dark mode** support
- **Accessible contrast ratios** using APCA
- **Transparent variants** for overlays and blending
- **P3 color gamut support** for vibrant displays

## Improvements

Since Radix Colors comes with the fork, I'm making sure they work consistently across all components:

- **Reusing color tokens** systematically across components
- **Proper alpha token usage** for overlays and transparency effects
- **Consistent semantic mapping** so colors mean the same thing everywhere
- **Unified material system** that works with both solid and translucent variants

This ensures that when you use a color in one component, it behaves predictably in all other components.
