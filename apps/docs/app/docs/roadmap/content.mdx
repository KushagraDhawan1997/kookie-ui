# Roadmap

I'm not shipping Kookie UI all at once. It grows gradually, based on what feels stable enough to use in real products. I release components when they meet that standard, not on arbitrary timelines.

## Current Focus

I'm working on core input components, navigation patterns, system experiences, and data components. For the full roadmap and what's coming next, check out the [public roadmap](https://github.com/kushagradhawan/kookie-ui/projects) where you can see progress and upcoming features.

## Development Philosophy

Components are released when they meet production standards, not on arbitrary timelines. This means:

- **Thoroughly tested** in real applications before public release
- **Complete documentation** with guidelines, specs, and API references
- **Accessibility compliant** with proper ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **TypeScript support** with full type definitions and JSDoc comments

## Current Status

### Stable Components

Core components like Button, Card, Text, Heading, Flex, Grid, and basic form elements are stable and ready for production use.

### Beta Components

Advanced components like Shell, Sidebar, Image, ToggleButton, and Chatbar are currently in beta and being tested in production at Womp.

### Coming Soon

Additional input components, navigation patterns, and data visualization components are in active development.

## Long-term Vision

Longer term, I'm hoping to ship **templates** for dashboards, marketing sites, authentication flows, and AI interfaces â€” not as frameworks, but as reliable starting points for common patterns.

These templates would provide:

- Complete page layouts with proper Shell architecture
- Authentication flows with forms and validation
- Dashboard layouts with data tables and charts
- Marketing site templates with hero sections and CTAs
- AI interface patterns for chat and conversation UIs

The goal is to provide not just individual components, but complete patterns that solve real problems developers face when building applications.
