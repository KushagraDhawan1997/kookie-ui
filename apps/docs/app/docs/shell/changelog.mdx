## Beta Status

<Callout.Root variant="soft" size="2" color="orange" my="7">
  <Callout.Text>The Shell component is in beta. APIs may change based on usage feedback and evolving requirements.</Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

### Known Limitations

**Current Constraints:**
- Composition rules are enforced through console warnings only
- Size persistence requires manual implementation
- Animation performance not optimized for very large content
- Limited customization of animation timing
- No built-in gesture support for mobile

**Planned Improvements:**
- Enhanced animation performance optimization
- Built-in size persistence implementations
- More granular animation timing controls
- Touch gesture support for mobile interactions
- Additional layout patterns and presets

### Feedback & Issues

The Shell component is actively developed based on real-world usage patterns. Current feedback areas:

**Layout Patterns:**
- Effectiveness of Rail+Panel vs Sidebar composition
- Responsive breakpoint timing and behavior
- Animation smoothness across different devices

**Developer Experience:**
- API clarity and ease of implementation
- TypeScript type accuracy and completeness
- Documentation completeness and examples

**Performance:**
- Animation performance with large content areas
- Memory usage with multiple shell instances
- Resize operation smoothness

## Migration Guide

### From Custom Layouts

If migrating from custom layout implementations:

**Before:**
```tsx
// Custom layout with manual state management
const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(false);
const [inspectorOpen, setInspectorOpen] = useState(false);

<div className="app-layout">
  <header>...</header>
  <div className="body">
    {sidebarOpen && <aside className="sidebar">...</aside>}
    <main>...</main>
    {inspectorOpen && <aside className="inspector">...</aside>}
  </div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Shell component with integrated state management
<Shell.Root>
  <Shell.Header>...</Shell.Header>
  <Shell.Sidebar defaultMode={{ initial: 'collapsed', md: 'expanded' }}>
    ...
  </Shell.Sidebar>
  <Shell.Content>...</Shell.Content>
  <Shell.Inspector defaultMode="collapsed">...</Shell.Inspector>
</Shell.Root>
```
