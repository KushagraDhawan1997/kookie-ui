# Overview

Kookie UI didn’t begin as a product. It began as a set of changes I kept making while trying to ship features quickly at Womp.  

Radix gave me a strong foundation — primitives that were accessible, solid defaults, and APIs I liked using. But as I worked with it every day, I ran into small gaps. A “surface” button didn’t behave the same way as a “surface” card. One component supported `panelBackground`, another didn’t. Sizes scaled differently depending on which component you picked. None of these were “flaws.” They just weren’t systematic enough for what we needed.  

Kookie UI is me trying to make those rules systematic. Instead of patching each issue as it came up, I began codifying patterns so the same decisions didn’t have to be made over and over again.  

The goal isn’t to replace Radix, or to claim I’ve built something better. The goal is to stand on Radix and extend it into a system that feels coherent across every layer of an application. That means fewer surprises, fewer inconsistencies, and more trust that the components you use will behave as expected.

## Additions

Kookie UI includes the same foundations you’d expect — spacing tokens, color tokens, motion tokens — but rebuilt systematically. On top of that, it ships with components that apply those rules consistently, so teams don’t have to remember them case by case.  

The density system adapts from compact SaaS layouts to touch-friendly mobile flows with four predictable size scales. The shell architecture gives you structural patterns for sidebars, panels, and toolbars that actually work together, rather than being independent pieces you have to glue yourself.  

Every component comes with documentation and API references, because this isn’t just an experiment. It’s already being tested in production at Womp, where inconsistency isn’t a cosmetic issue — it directly affects whether users can succeed or not.

## Radix Relationship

Kookie UI is a fork of [Radix Themes](https://radix-ui.com/themes), not just a wrapper around [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) primitives. Radix gave me strong building blocks, but it didn’t try to be a full design system. That’s where I stepped in.  

### What Stayed

I didn’t throw away what worked.  

- **Component foundation.** The accessibility and keyboard/screen reader support from Radix UI primitives remain intact.  
- **API style.** Familiar prop patterns, polymorphic `asChild` rendering, and overall developer experience are unchanged.  

### What Changed

What I did rebuild were the parts that didn’t feel systematic:  

- **Design tokens.** Radix’s 9-point scales were useful, but scattered with exceptions. I rewrote them into 12-point progressions with predictable steps for spacing, radius, and shadows.  
- **Material system.** Instead of `panelBackground` (limited to a few components), Kookie UI uses a universal material system. Every component understands translucency vs. solidity, with both theme-level defaults and per-component overrides.  
- **Sizing.** Cards, buttons, dropdowns, selects, and avatars all follow the same scale now. A size-1 button actually looks right inside a size-1 card.  
- **Icons.** Icon sizing is consistent across components. Segmented controls, selects, dropdowns, and buttons follow the same logic.  
- **Accessibility details.** I added native tooltip support, stricter aria-label enforcement for icon buttons, and small but meaningful improvements throughout.  
- **Motion.** Transition patterns are unified, so you don’t see one component glide while another snaps instantly.  

None of this means Radix did something wrong. Radix provided a toolkit. Kookie UI extends it into a design system.

## Enhancements

### Beyond UI Components

Kookie UI tries to go further than just buttons and inputs.  

- **Layout patterns.** Shells, split views, column layouts, and sidebars that behave predictably together. These aren’t extra components — they’re structural patterns that help build real applications.  
- **Modern components.** Toggle buttons, AI chat bars, and other elements that reflect how products are actually built today.  
- **Typography.** Expanded scales and weights so type feels consistent across contexts, not improvised.  

### Token Systems

- **Space.** Extended to 12 steps for compact and large interfaces, instead of being stuck with one rhythm.  
- **Radius.** Scales match spacing, which makes rounded corners feel deliberate instead of arbitrary.  
- **Color.** Simplified tokens that still follow a 12-step progression, with automatic dark mode support.  

### Universal Material

Every component supports a `material` prop:  

- **Theme-level defaults.** Set the global look (translucent or solid).  
- **Component overrides.** Change behavior per component when needed.  
- **Context awareness.** Dialogs, panels, and buttons each have sensible defaults.  
- **Elevation.** Material isn’t just visual — it communicates depth and layering.  
- **Deprecation path.** `panelBackground` is replaced gradually, not abruptly.  

### Production Use

- **Developer experience.** TypeScript, JSDoc, and familiar APIs.  
- **Accessibility.** Native tooltips, aria-label enforcement, consistent keyboard navigation.  
- **Interactions.** Unified icon sizes, smooth transitions, predictable states.  
- **Margin-agnostic.** Components don’t assume layout spacing. They just fit.
