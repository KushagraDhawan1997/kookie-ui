# What's Kookie UI

Kookie UI is an opinionated fork of Radix Themes. The visual style reflects my taste; it is not claimed to be objectively better than Radix. The goal is a cohesive, accessible system that makes product UI composition predictable.

## Foundation

Kookie builds on Radix's primitives and accessibility work, then forks the Themes layer. Tokens for size, spacing, radii, typography, and elevation are aligned so parts fit together without local fixes. New and refined components (for example, ToggleButton, ToggleIconButton, Image) follow the same scales and behavior.

## Cohesion

Components are designed to compose. A card at size 1 with a button at size 1 should align in radius, padding, and density—no overrides. The same expectation holds across inputs in forms, items in toolbars, and controls embedded in panels or overlays. As an example of this principle, common surfaces like Dialog or Card can expose a standard toolbar slot for titles and actions; this keeps affordances consistent without reinventing a header each time.

## Patterns

Beyond individual parts, Kookie defines layout patterns for application surfaces. Patterns describe where pieces live and how they behave across breakpoints. Examples include Shell—a layout engine with named regions such as Header, Rail, Panel, Sidebar, Content, Inspector, and Bottom—and a more general Split View for two-area layouts. These are examples, not a complete list; the set is intentionally open-ended.

## Contracts

Contracts are explicit rules that components and patterns agree to: allowed placement, sizing behavior, focus and keyboard expectations, and named slots. Contracts separate UI structure from application logic, so the same rules apply across pages and teams. This reduces ad-hoc scaffolding and keeps interaction details predictable.

## Not this

Kookie is not an application framework; it does not provide routing, data fetching, or global state.

Kookie is not a from-scratch primitives library; it builds on Radix and forks at Themes.

Kookie does not claim objective visual superiority over Radix.

Kookie is not a closed catalog of patterns; any examples here are illustrative, not exhaustive.
