# What's Kookie UI

I kept running into the same problems while building interfaces. I couldn't find a complete design system that I trusted - not just for the visuals, but for the underlying patterns. The libraries I tried either weren't cohesive enough, lacked versatility for different use cases, or didn't scale well when I needed them to. Even the really good ones like Radix UI and Shadcn had their limitations - Radix wasn't consistent across components, and while Shadcn is amazing, it felt more like individual components than a unified system.

I started building Kookie UI to solve this for myself. Radix Themes came closest to what I wanted, so I thought "I can make it my own" and forked it. Kookie UI begins with patterns — the rules that govern interaction, hierarchy, density, and rhythm — and then provides components that follow those rules automatically. The components are meant to make the patterns easy to apply, not to replace the thinking behind them.

I'm not making flashy new UI. I'm trying to reduce friction. Interfaces feel better when spacing, colors, transitions, and accessibility work the same way everywhere. Kookie UI tries to codify those boring but essential details so I don't have to keep patching them one component at a time.

## What I'm Building

Kookie UI includes the same foundations you'd expect — spacing tokens, color tokens, motion tokens — but I'm trying to rebuild them systematically. On top of that, it ships with components that apply those rules consistently, so you don't have to remember them case by case.

The density system adapts from compact SaaS layouts to touch-friendly mobile flows with four predictable size scales. The shell architecture gives you structural patterns for sidebars, panels, and toolbars that actually work together, rather than being independent pieces you have to glue yourself.

Every component comes with comprehensive documentation for both designers and developers, because this isn't just an experiment. It's already being tested in production at Womp, where inconsistency isn't a cosmetic issue — it directly affects whether users can succeed or not.

### Designer Docs

I'm building detailed design guidance because I believe design and development should work together seamlessly:

- **Guidelines** explain the psychological principles behind design decisions, common mistakes to avoid, and how to create effective hierarchies
- **Specs** provide exact measurements, spacing rules, and design tokens for consistent implementation
- **Design patterns** that help designers understand when and why to use each component variant

### Developer Docs

Technical implementation is equally comprehensive:

- **API references** cover all props, methods, and technical details
- **Playground examples** show real code that can be copied and customized
- **TypeScript support** with full type definitions and JSDoc comments

This approach ensures design decisions are preserved from concept to implementation, reducing the gap between design and development that leads to inconsistent user experiences.

## Philosophy

Kookie UI is intentionally boring. I'm not trying to reinvent interface design or chase design trends. Instead, I'm trying to codify the non-negotiables: spacing systems, semantic colors, accessible defaults, predictable motion, and interaction rules that behave consistently.

The idea is simple: once the basics are solid, you can focus on the parts of your product that actually make it unique. Patterns handle the baseline, components enforce the patterns, and the rest of your product can grow without carrying that overhead.

The result isn't magic or perfection. It's a foundation you can trust just enough to spend your energy on higher-level problems.
