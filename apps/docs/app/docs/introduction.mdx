# Introduction

I kept running into the same problems while building interfaces. I couldn't find a complete design system that I trusted - not just for the visuals, but for the underlying patterns. The libraries I tried either weren't cohesive enough, lacked versatility for different use cases, or didn't scale well when I needed them to. Even the really good ones like Radix UI and Shadcn had their limitations - Radix wasn't consistent across components, and while Shadcn is amazing, it felt more like individual components than a unified system.

I started building Kookie UI to solve this for myself. Radix Themes came closest to what I wanted, so I thought "I can make it my own" and forked it. Kookie UI begins with patterns — the rules that govern interaction, hierarchy, density, and rhythm — and then provides components that follow those rules automatically. The components are meant to make the patterns easy to apply, not to replace the thinking behind them.

I'm not making flashy new UI. I'm trying to reduce friction. Interfaces feel better when spacing, colors, transitions, and accessibility work the same way everywhere. Kookie UI tries to codify those boring but essential details so I don't have to keep patching them one component at a time.
