# Introduction

Most component libraries give you a toolbox and expect you to figure out how the tools work together. We think that's backwards. Kookie User Interface starts with proven patterns—how actions should feel, how overlays should behave, how navigation should flow—then builds components that make those patterns automatic.

This isn't theory. It's how we build Womp, where interface complexity demands bulletproof foundations. When you're managing 3D scenes with dozens of panels, buttons, and controls, every inconsistency becomes user friction. The system has to work without thinking about it.

The result feels more like Apple's Human Interface Guidelines than a typical React library. We make decisions so you don't have to. The components follow established patterns, handle accessibility automatically, and scale from dense tool interfaces to touch-friendly mobile flows through a single size system.

## Roadmap

Kookie User Interface evolves continuously based on real product needs. We ship components when they meet production standards, not arbitrary deadlines.

Next up: comprehensive input components (TextField, TextArea, Switch, Checkbox, Radio), navigation patterns (Tabs, Toolbar, Command Palette), and system experiences (Dialog, Drawer, Popover). Rich data components like virtualized Tables follow, along with composed components like UserCard and PropertyControl that solve common interface problems.

Templates for marketing sites, dashboards, authentication flows, and AI interfaces will provide complete starting points for common application patterns.

## Philosophy

We make the boring parts explicit so you can focus on the interesting ones.

Kookie User Interface is boring by design. It doesn't try to be flashy or reinvent interface patterns. Instead, it codifies the non-negotiables—consistent spacing, semantic colors, accessible interactions, predictable motion—freeing your team to focus on what makes your product unique.

When designers control the design tokens and developers consume the system, updates flow automatically from design decisions to production code. This isn't theory. It's how we ship Womp, where interface density and complexity demand a bulletproof foundation.

The result is clarity, consistency, and speed. Your product's personality shines through the foundation, not despite it.
